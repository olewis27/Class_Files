		<h1>Work outs that are effiencient!</h1>

		<p>Ever find yourself sitting quietly on your favorite bench away from the activity on the gym floor and wondering what exactly are all these people doing here? Of course not; you’re healthy, but I do. I’m deranged, paranoid and lonely. Two more sets before another amazing workout is complete, I feel like a million (wiped out, aching and red-eyed) and a generous calm has flooded my pulverized body. Who are they, where do they come and what are they doing here?</p><br>

		<p>What are their expectations, to what level do they apply themselves, how committed are they and how committed do they become? Hmmm.... I watch, assess and hit another set before I’m busted or lose my pump.</p><br>

		<p>They been coming for years, three or so, and has gained direction and form. When she first walked the floor her steps were tentative and her expression was fearful. Within a month I knew this one would stick; she needed it, her face showed it, she wasn’t young and exercise gave her hope. She was a bit lonely, I guessed, and I saw some youth returning to her eyes and to the curves on her body. This day, three years later, she appeared younger, stronger, brighter and more certain.</p><br>
